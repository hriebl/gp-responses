This repository contains the code for my paper on Gaussian process
responses in distributional regression, i.e.Â the scripts for the
simulation study, the application section, and the figures. These
scripts build on the following R packages, which I develop in separate
repositories:

  - [bamlssAPI](https://github.com/hriebl/bamlssAPI)
  - [bamlssGP](https://github.com/hriebl/bamlssGP)
  - [ggnuplot](https://github.com/hriebl/ggnuplot)

Here is the full list of R packages that are required to run the code in
this repository:

  - bamlss
  - bamlssGP
  - coda
  - devtools
  - dplyr
  - forcats
  - fuzzyjoin
  - geosphere
  - ggnuplot
  - ggplot2
  - here
  - janitor
  - knitr
  - mvtnorm
  - parallel
  - purrr
  - readr
